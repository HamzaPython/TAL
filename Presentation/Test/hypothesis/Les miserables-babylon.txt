Chapter I
M. MYRIEL
In 1815, Mr. Charles-Fran√ßois-Welcome Myriel was Bishop of Digne. It was an old man of about seventy-five years, he occupied the seat of worthy since 1806. Although this detail does not in any way to the substance of what we have to tell, it may not be useless, if only to be exact in any, indicate here the noises and remarks which had accrued on its account at the time he arrived in the diocese.
