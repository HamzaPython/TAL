CHAPTER I
Mr. MYRIEL
In 1815, Mr. Charles-Fran√ßois-Bienvenu Myriel was bishop of Digne. He was an old man of about seventy-five years old, he had occupied the seat of Digne since 1806. Although this detail does not in any way touch the very depth of what we have to tell, it is perhaps not useless, if only to be exact in everything, to indicate here the noises and the remarks which had run on his account at the moment when he had arrived in the diocese.
